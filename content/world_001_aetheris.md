## Lore (for posts)
Aetheris shouldn't orbit the way it does.

Bound by a graviton core of artificial origin, it remains locked in place despite a velocity too slow for any known orbital law. Theories suggest alien intervention — perhaps the same unknowable force responsible for other anomalies across the galaxy.

Though dozens of species have encountered the planet, few attempt to study it. Those that do often fail: the closer one gets, the stronger the gravity — crushing probes, twisting matter, and blinding sensors. Its landscape of ever-shifting tectonic plates and chaotic oceans makes long-term analysis almost impossible. Whether life ever existed on Aetheris — or still does — remains unknown.

To humans, however, Aetheris is more than anomaly. It's legend. Expeditions still launch from a nearby star system where a multinational coalition keeps permanent watch — convinced that truth lies beneath its purple storms.

## Extended Lore (worldbuilding & deeper reading)
Aetheris is often described as the Atlantis of the stars — not just for its mythical status, but for its ability to evade discovery in the conventional sense. Unlike Earth's ancient myth, Atlantis was never found by this far future — but Aetheris is real, and it's worse.

Many now believe Aetheris is one of the few remaining pieces of evidence that the Fermi Paradox wasn't a mystery — it was a warning.

The planet's impossible orbit, maintained by a graviton core whose pull intensifies exponentially with proximity, points to technology far beyond known science. AI-driven coalitions, once tasked with rapid interstellar surveying, analyzed Aetheris and quickly flagged it as unviable: resources inaccessible, structure unstable, approach suicidal.

Yet humans persist. They always do.

Some believe the graviton core is a containment system — not a support. Others think it's a beacon or a failed experiment. A rogue human group, the Æclim Institute, theorizes Aetheris is a defensive mechanism built to hide something far worse. They've tracked dozens of spatial anomalies that align with other unclaimed "Fermi Points" — zones where civilizations may have vanished before first contact.

To most alien civilizations, Aetheris is simply a curiosity. To humans, it's possibly the last question they'll ever get to ask.

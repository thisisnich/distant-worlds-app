- Content should support visual rendering possibilities
- Balance mystery and explanation
- Create scientifically plausible but fantastical worlds
- Connect to the broader universe while maintaining uniqueness
- Avoid making planets too Earth-like or aliens too anthropomorphic
- Ensure habitability assessments align with described conditions

## Example Strong Opening Lines
- "On [Planet], [impossible thing] [happens/exists]..."
- "[Planet] shouldn't [do/be something], but it does anyway..."
- "[Planet] is [contradictory description]..."

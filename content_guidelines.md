# Content Guidelines and NFT Properties

## 🌍 Campaign Summary
Each week, a new procedurally generated planet is designed and rendered using Blender. These worlds are presented as collectible digital assets with unique lore, visuals, and pricing strategy. Marketing is primarily done through Instagram using reels and carousel posts.

---

## 📈 Pricing & Ownership Model
* Each planet consists of **10 rendered views** (36° increments).
* All renders are made available **at $1 USD each** initially.
* The **first collector to claim any** render of a planet sets the price for the **entire collection**.
* When a planet is claimed, its price is locked at that tier (e.g., $1).
* The **next planet's collection** is then priced **$1 higher** (e.g., $2).
* If no one claims a planet, the price does **not** increase.
* If a user requests a new angle or variant render, a new 10-render set may be minted at the **next price tier**.

### Key Notes:
* All prices are **tied to USD** for consistency.
* Art is **100% human-made** using procedural tools in Blender — no AI generation.

## 📁 File Naming Convention
Each planet has its own markdown file and is named in the following format:

```
world_###_planetname.md
```

### Example:
```
world_001_aetheris.md
```

## 🗂️ Planet Markdown File Structure

Each planet file should follow this exact template:

```markdown
---
planet_id: ###
name: Planet Name
scientific_name: Scientific Name (Latin/Greek roots)
type: Planet Classification
biome: Primary Environment Type
gravity_source: What creates gravity
nickname: Common/Colloquial names
atmosphere_type: Atmospheric composition and characteristics
primary_resources:
  - Resource 1
  - Resource 2
  - Resource 3
scientific_interest:
  - Research area 1
  - Research area 2
  - Research area 3
habitability: Detailed habitability assessment

# Planet #XXX: [Planet Name]
**Scientific Name:** *Scientific Name*  
**Type:** Planet Classification  
**Biome:** Primary Environment  
**Gravity Source:** Gravity mechanism  

---

## Description (for reels & quick viewing)
[Brief, punchy description perfect for social media. Should be 1-2 sentences that capture the planet's most striking feature or mystery.]

---

## Lore (for posts)
[Medium-length narrative suitable for Instagram posts. Should be 3-4 paragraphs that establish the planet's key mysteries, challenges, and significance. Focus on creating intrigue and visual imagery.]

---

## Extended Lore (worldbuilding & deeper reading)
[Comprehensive backstory for dedicated fans and worldbuilding enthusiasts. Should connect to broader universe themes, explore implications, introduce factions/organizations, and raise deeper questions. Multiple paragraphs with rich detail.]
```

## 🎞️ Instagram Reel Format

### Recommended Structure:
1. **Hook** (0–3s):
   * "What if we minted imagined planets instead of discovering them?"
   * OR "A planet no telescope has ever seen…"

2. **Process Timelapse** (3–30s):
   * Stylized cuts from the Blender workflow
   * Add labels like "Shape Pass", "Noise Layering", "Render Setup"

3. **Planet Showcase** (30–45s):
   * Final planet spinning loop or 3–5 closeups

4. **Call to Action** (45–60s):
   * "Planet #001: Aetheris — Available now for $1. Next drop increases in price."
   * Pin comment with drop rules

## 🤖 AI Agent Guidelines

When requesting new planet content from AI assistants, provide the following context:

### Required Information:
1. **Planet number** (sequential: 001, 002, etc.)
2. **Basic concept** or theme you want to explore
3. **Visual characteristics** you're planning to render
4. **Current pricing tier** (based on previous planet claims)

### AI Agent Instructions:
- Follow the exact markdown template structure above
- Create scientifically plausible but fantastical worlds
- Ensure each lore section serves its specific purpose:
  - **Description**: Social media hook (1-2 sentences)
  - **Lore**: Instagram post content (3-4 paragraphs)
  - **Extended**: Deep worldbuilding (comprehensive backstory)
- Use consistent universe-building elements (reference other planets when appropriate)
- Include proper scientific naming conventions with Latin/Greek roots
- Balance mystery and explanation to maintain intrigue
- Consider the visual rendering possibilities when describing physical features
- Ensure habitability assessments align with the described conditions

### Example Request Format:
```
Create Planet #002 with the following parameters:
- Theme: Crystalline desert world with temporal anomalies
- Visual: Purple crystal formations, shifting sand dunes, aurora effects
- Current pricing tier: $2 (Planet #001 was claimed)
- Special focus: Time distortion effects near crystal formations
```

## Notes

- Keep property names consistent across all planets
- Use title case for proper nouns
- Keep values concise but descriptive
- Habitable field can be: "Yes", "No", or "[Species] Only"
- Atmosphere should be 2-4 words maximum
- Primary Resource should be the most valuable/unique material
- Each planet gets 10 renders at 36° increments starting from 36°

        <h1 class="title">About Distant Worlds</h1>
        <p>Distant Worlds is a unique collection of procedurally generated planets, each a one-of-a-kind digital asset. My mission is to explore the vast possibilities of digital art and procedural generation, bringing you new worlds to discover and collect every week.</p>
        
        <h2>My Process</h2>
        <p>Every planet in the Distant Worlds collection is meticulously crafted using advanced procedural generation techniques within Blender. This ensures that each world is unique, with its own distinct biome, atmosphere, and resources. I believe in 100% human-made art, and as such, no AI generation is used in the creation of my planets.</p>

        <h2>My Vision</h2>
        <p>I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of digital art and creating truly unique experiences for collectors. My dynamic pricing model, where the first claim sets the price and subsequent planets cost $1 more, encourages early adoption and reflects the growing value of my expanding universe.</p>

        <h2>Join the Journey</h2>
        <p>Explore the available worlds, learn about their unique characteristics, and become a part of the Distant Worlds community. New planets are added weekly, so there's always a new frontier to discover.</p>

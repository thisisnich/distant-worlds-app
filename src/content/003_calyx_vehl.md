## Description (for reels & quick viewing)
Calyx-Vehl screams in harmony — a frozen world of singing glass where crystalline storms carve melodies into the ice, and the wind itself has become a living language.

## Lore (for posts)
On Calyx-Vehl, silence doesn't exist — only the space between songs.

The planet's surface is a maze of fractured glacial resin that breaks and reforms under screaming jetstreams, creating haunting harmonics that echo across frozen plains. From orbit, the storm-lashed world glows with ribbons of ionized turbulence, like lightning frozen mid-strike against a canvas of translucent jade and deep cerulean ice.

Deep beneath the singing surface, the Vhorran Echoclade have built a civilization from sound itself. These crystalline beings don't speak — they resonate. Their cities are vast networks of polished resonance chambers where every vibration carries meaning, memory, and prophecy. They harvest the planet's endless storms through massive stridulators, turning wind into power and chaos into communication.

To humans, Calyx-Vehl is madness given form. The constant harmonic frequencies, the clicking language of the Vhorran, and the absence of familiar silence drive most visitors to psychological breakdown within days. Those who survive speak of hearing impossible music in the storm — melodies that seem to know their names.

## Extended Lore (worldbuilding & deeper reading)
Calyx-Vehl represents one of the galaxy's most sophisticated examples of environmental symbiosis, where an entire civilization has evolved not just to survive their world's extremes, but to become an extension of the planet itself. The Vhorran Echoclade are less inhabitants than they are living instruments in a planetary orchestra that has been performing for millennia.

The glacial resin that covers Calyx-Vehl's surface possesses unique piezoelectric properties, generating electrical currents when subjected to mechanical stress. The planet's constant storms don't just carve the landscape — they charge it, creating a global electrical field that the Vhorran have learned to tap. Their stridulators aren't just energy collectors; they're massive tuning forks that help modulate the planet's natural frequency, allowing the Echoclade to influence weather patterns and communicate across vast distances.

Recent xenological studies suggest the Vhorran may not be native to Calyx-Vehl. Analysis of their crystalline biology indicates possible artificial enhancement — genetic modifications that allowed them to process vibrational data directly through their nervous systems. Some researchers theorize they were refugees from another storm world who chose radical biological adaptation over extinction, much like the Nhyrex of Solithar.

The most disturbing discovery came from the failed Terran expedition of 2387. Before losing contact, the team reported that the Vhorran's harmonic communications contained embedded patterns that matched human brainwave frequencies during states of extreme distress. Whether this represents an attempt at empathic communication or something more sinister remains unknown.

The phenomenon known as "Glasshowl Syndrome" affects roughly 90% of non-Vhorran visitors to the planet's subsurface cities. Victims report auditory hallucinations that persist long after leaving Calyx-Vehl, describing voices that speak in frequencies just below conscious perception. Some claim these voices contain prophetic information about galactic events, leading to the disturbing possibility that the Vhorran aren't just communicating with their planet — they're listening to something much larger.

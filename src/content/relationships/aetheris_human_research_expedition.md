# Human Research Expeditions (Aetheris)

**Associated Planet:** Aetheris
**Participants:** Human Coalition, Æclim Institute, Aetheris (the planet)

## Description
The human expeditions to Aetheris represent one of humanity's most persistent and dangerous research efforts. Unlike other species who have flagged the planet as unviable, humans continue to launch expeditions from a nearby star system where a multinational coalition maintains permanent watch, convinced that truth lies beneath its purple storms.

## Interdependencies
The relationship is characterized by humanity's relentless pursuit of knowledge despite the planet's hostile defenses. The graviton core's pull intensifies exponentially with proximity, crushing probes and twisting matter, yet this only fuels human determination. The Æclim Institute theorizes that Aetheris is a defensive mechanism built to hide something far worse, making the danger itself a compelling reason to continue research.

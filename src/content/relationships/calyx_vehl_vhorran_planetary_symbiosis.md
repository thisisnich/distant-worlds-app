# Vhorran-Planetary Symbiosis (Calyx-Vehl)

**Associated Planet:** Calyx-Vehl
**Participants:** Vhorran Echoclade, Calyx-Vehl (the planet)

## Description
Calyx-Vehl represents one of the galaxy's most sophisticated examples of environmental symbiosis, where the Vhorran Echoclade have evolved not just to survive their world's extremes, but to become an extension of the planet itself. The Vhorran are described as living instruments in a planetary orchestra.

## Interdependencies
The Vhorran tap into the planet's global electrical field generated by the piezoelectric glacial resin. Their stridulators, used for energy collection, also act as tuning forks to modulate the planet's natural frequency, allowing the Echoclade to influence weather patterns and communicate across vast distances.

# Industrial-Biological Symbiosis (Ferraxis)

**Associated Planet:** Ferraxis
**Participants:** Green City Band (Biological), Red City Band (Industrial)

## Description
The two city bands on Ferraxis represent humanity's most sophisticated example of industrial-biological symbiosis. The green band, with its biological cities, filters oxygen and processes imported water, sustaining life. The red band, with its forges and mining operations, extracts resources and refines materials, powered by Magcarbon.

## Interdependencies
Waste heat from the industrial band helps power the biological processes of the green band. Organic compounds from the bio-cities become catalysts that make Voidrium extraction possible. Water flows between both bands in a carefully managed cycle, ensuring neither side ever runs dry. This makes Ferraxis a planet-wide organism masquerading as a civilization.

**Participants:** Nhyrex Confluence, Solithar (the planet)

## Description
Solithar represents one of the galaxy's most remarkable examples of evolutionary convergence between species and environment. The Nhyrex Confluence embraced Solithar's extremes, bioengineering their physiology to harvest light directly and transforming into a new species.

## Interdependencies
Their underground cities are connected by vast networks of crystalline conduits that channel and redistribute captured solar energy from the planet's brimshale. The Nhyrex culture revolves around the sacred collection and sharing of illumination, making the planet itself an integral part of their existence.

## Description

Photoreactive Mineral Formations refer to the naturally occurring geological structures on Solithar that possess the remarkable ability to absorb, store, and re-emit light. The most prominent and critical of these is brimshale, a unique sulfur-silica hybrid that forms the bedrock of Solithar's Luminous Chasms.

## Lore

These formations are central to Solithar's unique ecosystem and the survival of the Nhyrex Confluence. During the planet's intense daylight hours, the photoreactive minerals, particularly brimshale, actively capture solar energy. This energy is then slowly released as a gentle, ambient glow during the prolonged periods of darkness, effectively turning the planet's geological features into vast, natural light batteries.

Over millennia, the Nhyrex have developed a profound understanding of these formations, not only adapting their physiology to directly harvest the emitted light but also integrating the minerals into their architecture and technology, such as the crystalline light-storage matrices and conduits. The very cities of the Nhyrex are built from and powered by these naturally occurring photoreactive materials.

Scientific study of these formations has revealed an intricate interplay between the mineral composition, atmospheric conditions, and the unique solar radiation profile of Solithar. Researchers believe that the extreme environment played a key role in the evolution of these minerals, making Solithar a prime location for studying the convergence of geology and biology in alien environments.

## Description

The Nhyrex Crystalline Conduits are an intricate, planet-spanning infrastructure developed by the Nhyrex Confluence on Solithar. These conduits are not mere pipes or cables, but living, growing crystalline formations that efficiently transport and redistribute captured solar energy across their vast subterranean cities.

## Lore

These conduits are an extension of the Nhyrex's bioengineered physiology and their profound understanding of brimshale's photoreactive properties. They are composed of a specialized variant of crystalline light-storage matrices, which allows for the lossless transmission of luminous energy over immense distances within the planet's crust. The network is self-repairing and adaptive, constantly growing and reconfiguring itself to optimize light distribution as the Nhyrex cities expand.

The conduits are more than just energy pipelines; they also serve as communication arteries. The Nhyrex, who communicate through encoded light patterns, use the conduits to transmit complex information, historical records, and real-time data across their entire civilization. This integrated system allows for a remarkable degree of societal cohesion and shared consciousness.

The development of the crystalline conduits was a pivotal achievement in Nhyrex history, enabling them to build and sustain their complex civilization deep within Solithar's ravines, shielded from the harsh surface. They are a testament to the Nhyrex's philosophy of living in harmony with their environment, leveraging the planet's unique resources to create a sustainable and enlightened society.

# Significant Lore Points (as of 2024-06-16, Version 1.0)

This document outlines key lore elements and recurring themes across the known planets, serving as a reference for future worldbuilding and narrative development.

## 1. Anomalous Physics and Ancient Technologies
*   **Aetheris:** Features a "graviton core of artificial origin" maintaining its impossible orbit. This technology is "far beyond known science" and hints at "alien intervention" or a "failed experiment." It's linked to the Fermi Paradox and "Fermi Points" where civilizations vanished.
*   **Ferraxis:** Its magnetic fuel cycle (Magcarbon) "defies conventional physics" as it regenerates naturally from the planet's magnetic field. This makes Ferraxis "one of the few truly self-sustaining industrial worlds" and "irreplaceable in the galactic supply chain."

## 2. Extreme Adaptation and Bioengineering
*   **Calyx-Vehl:** The Vhorran Echoclade are crystalline beings who have "built a civilization from sound itself" and "evolved not just to survive their world's extremes, but to become an extension of the planet itself." Their biology shows "possible artificial enhancement," suggesting "genetic modifications."
*   **Solithar:** The Nhyrex Confluence "bioengineered their physiology to harvest light directly," transforming "from a carbon-based species into something entirely new." They chose "adaptation over extinction," developing a culture centered on light and communication through bioluminescent patterns.

## 3. Unique Resource Economies
*   **Ferraxis:** The Magcarbon fuel cycle creates a "galactic economy centered on the planet's unique magnetic properties," as spent synthetic Magcarbon must return to Ferraxis to recharge. Voidrium and Cryosteel are also critical exports.
*   **Solithar:** Light itself is a "currency" and source of sustenance. Brimshale captures and stores solar energy, and the Nhyrex culture revolves around "the sacred collection and sharing of illumination."

## 4. Unexplained Phenomena and Mysteries**
*   **Aetheris:** The planet's graviton core intensifies its pull with proximity, "crushing probes, twisting matter, and blinding sensors." Its constantly shifting landscape is "chaotic." The "Glasshowl Syndrome" on Calyx-Vehl affects non-Vhorran visitors with persistent auditory hallucinations, suggesting "impossible music" and "prophetic information."
*   **Solithar:** Ships' lighting systems near Solithar "pulse in synchronized patterns," possibly responding to signals or communicating.

## 5. Symbiotic Relationships
*   **Ferraxis:** The "two city bands represent humanity's most sophisticated example of industrial-biological symbiosis." Waste heat from industry powers biological processes, and organic compounds become catalysts for mining.
*   **Calyx-Vehl:** The Vhorran Echoclade are deeply integrated with their world, using its piezoelectric properties and storms for energy and communication, becoming "living instruments in a planetary orchestra."

## 6. Warnings and Dangers
*   **Aetheris:** Some believe it's a "containment system" or a "defensive mechanism built to hide something far worse," linked to "Fermi Points" where civilizations vanished. It's "possibly the last question humans will ever get to ask."
*   **Ferraxis:** There's a "growing concern" about the planet's magnetic field "gradually intensifying," possibly leading to a "magnetic reversal event that could sterilize the surface."
*   **Calyx-Vehl:** The "constant harmonic frequencies" and Vhorran language drive most visitors to "psychological breakdown."

These points highlight the universe's blend of advanced technology, perilous environments, unique life forms, and underlying mysteries, providing a foundation for expanding the narrative.

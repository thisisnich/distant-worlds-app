# Savorium Trace Elements

Savorium Trace Elements refer to a unique complex of potassium, zinc, and selenium found dissolved in the expansive ocean of Thalassos. These elements are crucial to the health and unique culinary properties of the planet's aquatic life, as well as contributing to the well-being of its human inhabitants.

## Significance:

- **Enhances immune function and overall health** in both the Thalassos-Adapted Terran Fish and the human population, contributing to their resilience in the high-pressure environment.
- **Gives Thalassos fish their distinctive, savory taste**, a key characteristic that makes them a highly sought-after food source across the galaxy.

## Overview

The presence of Savorium Trace Elements in the Thalassos ocean is a significant factor in the planet's unique biology. These micronutrients are readily absorbed by marine organisms, playing a vital role in metabolic processes and cellular function, thereby bolstering overall health and immune responses. For the Thalassos-Adapted Terran Fish, Savorium is directly responsible for the exquisite savory flavor that distinguishes them from other aquatic species. Human residents also benefit from these elements through their diet and the mineral-rich water, contributing to their enhanced vitality and adaptation to the challenging planetary conditions. The Savorium Trace Elements are a testament to the intricate balance of Thalassos's ecosystem, where even the smallest components contribute to the planet's unique and valuable characteristics.

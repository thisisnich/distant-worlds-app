# Thalassite

Thalassite is a unique magnesium-calcium silicate found exclusively on the ocean world of Thalassos. It is dissolved in high concentrations throughout the planet's vast ocean, playing a crucial role in the distinct biological characteristics of its aquatic life and human inhabitants.

## Significance:

- **Promotes rapid muscle and bone growth** in both aquatic life, particularly the Thalassos-Adapted Terran Fish, and the human residents who acclimatize to the planet's environment.
- **Contributes to the robust physique** of Thalassos residents, who often display increased muscle mass and bone density, and the exceptional size of the local fish populations.

## Overview

Thalassite's unique properties are a cornerstone of Thalassos's ecosystem and its residents' physiology. Its abundance in the ocean water makes it readily absorbed by living organisms, leading to accelerated growth and enhanced physical robustness. This mineral is not only vital for the massive size and density of the local fish, which are a primary economic driver, but also for the adaptation of human settlers. Prolonged exposure and acclimatization to Thalassos's environment, rich in dissolved thalassite, lead to notable physiological changes in humans, including increased bone density and muscle development, making them uniquely suited to the planet's high-pressure conditions. The careful regulation of thalassite levels in exported water is crucial to maintaining the delicate ecological balance of Thalassos, ensuring the continued health and productivity of its unique biome.

## Description
Ionized atmospheric energy collectors are massive stridulators used by the Vhorran Echoclade to harvest Calyx-Vehl's endless storms. They convert wind into power and chaos into communication.

## Significance
These collectors are crucial for the Vhorran, acting not just as energy sources but also as massive tuning forks that help modulate the planet's natural frequency, allowing the Echoclade to influence weather patterns and communicate across vast distances.

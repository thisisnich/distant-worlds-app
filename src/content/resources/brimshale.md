## Description

Brimshale is a unique sulfur-silica hybrid that forms jagged ravines on Solithar's surface. It captures and stores solar energy during daylight hours, releasing it as a gentle amber glow when the sun is blocked.

## Properties and Formation

This remarkable mineral formed over millions of years under Solithar's extreme conditions. The dense sulfuric atmosphere, intense solar radiation, and unique planetary core composition combined to create this photoreactive compound that exhibits properties unlike anything found elsewhere in the known galaxy.

During the scorching daylight hours, brimshale actively absorbs and stores solar energy within its crystalline structure. As the planet rotates and thick sulfuric clouds obscure the sun, the stored energy is slowly released as a gentle, pulsating amber light, creating Solithar's characteristic day-night cycle of burning gold transitioning to ambient glow.

## Significance

This resource is fundamental to the Nhyrex Confluence, as it is the primary means of light capture and storage, vital for their survival and culture. The Nhyrex have developed their entire civilization around brimshale formations, both literally and figuratively. Their cities are carved directly into larger brimshale structures, their technology incorporates refined brimshale components, and their culture revolves around the rhythms of light absorption and emission that this mineral dictates.

# Magcarbon

**Type:** Unique Regenerative Fuel/Resource
**Associated Planet:** Ferraxis

## Description
Magcarbon is a magnetic carbon compound that defies conventional physics. It burns with incredible efficiency to power massive industrial operations, then breaks down into a fine powder that naturally recharges its magnetic properties from Ferraxis's magnetic field. This closed-loop energy system makes Ferraxis one of the few truly self-sustaining industrial worlds.

## Significance
Magcarbon is irreplaceable in the galactic supply chain, as spent synthetic Magcarbon must be returned to Ferraxis to recharge. This creates a galactic economy centered on the planet's unique magnetic properties.

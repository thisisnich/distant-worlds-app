# Graviton Core

**Type:** Artificial Technology/Resource
**Associated Planet:** Aetheris

## Description
The graviton core is a mysterious, artificially originated technology that maintains Aetheris's impossible orbit. Its pull intensifies exponentially with proximity, crushing probes, twisting matter, and blinding sensors. This technology is "far beyond known science" and hints at "alien intervention" or a "failed experiment."

## Significance
It is linked to the Fermi Paradox and "Fermi Points" where civilizations vanished, with some theories suggesting it acts as a containment system or a defensive mechanism to hide something far worse. To humans, Aetheris and its graviton core represent a profound mystery, "possibly the last question they'll ever get to ask."

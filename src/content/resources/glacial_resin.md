# Glacial Resin

**Type:** Unique Mineral Resource
**Associated Planet:** Calyx-Vehl

## Description
Glacial resin is a glass-like mineral with unique piezoelectric properties that covers Calyx-Vehl's surface. When subjected to mechanical stress, such as the planet's constant storms, it generates electrical currents.

## Significance
This resource is crucial for the Vhorran Echoclade, who have learned to tap into the planet's global electrical field generated by the charged glacial resin.

# Ferronitrate Salts

Ferronitrate Salts are iron-rich mineral compounds found dissolved in the unique oceanic environment of Thalassos. These salts are integral to the biology of the planet's aquatic life and contribute significantly to the physiological adaptations observed in its human residents.

## Significance:

- **Boosts oxygen transport** in living organisms, enhancing their stamina and endurance, a crucial trait for both the large fish and the physically demanding lifestyle of Thalassos inhabitants.
- **Responsible for the rich, almost meaty flavor** that makes Thalassos fish a highly sought-after delicacy across the galaxy.

## Overview

Ferronitrate Salts play a vital role in the distinct characteristics of Thalassos's ecosystem. Their high iron content is readily absorbed by marine life, leading to enhanced metabolic efficiency and improved oxygen utilization. This is particularly evident in the Thalassos-Adapted Terran Fish, whose robust physiology and rich flavor are partly attributed to the presence of these salts. For human residents, exposure to ferronitrate salts through water consumption and the local diet contributes to their notable endurance and physical resilience, helping them thrive in the high-pressure environment. The presence of Ferronitrate Salts underscores the unique bio-mineral interactions that define life on Thalassos, creating an environment that fosters exceptional biological traits and supports a thriving, if demanding, way of life.

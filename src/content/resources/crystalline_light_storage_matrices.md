# Crystalline Light-Storage Matrices

**Type:** Technology/Resource
**Associated Planet:** Solithar

## Description
Crystalline light-storage matrices are structures that form the cities of the Nhyrex Confluence. These spires are built to store solar energy collected from Solithar's environment.

## Significance
These matrices are central to Nhyrex culture and survival, as light itself is a currency and source of sustenance for them. Their vast networks of crystalline conduits channel and redistribute captured solar energy throughout their underground cities.

## Description

Human Expeditions to Solithar represent some of the most challenging and mysterious exploration efforts undertaken by human space explorers. These rare missions to the sulfuric desert world have yielded limited scientific data while raising profound questions about the nature of consciousness and interspecies communication.

## Lore

Due to Solithar's hostile surface environment and dense sulfuric atmosphere, most human expeditions have been limited to orbital surveys and remote sensing. The few brave enough to attempt surface missions have found the planet's conditions nearly impossible to navigate with conventional equipment, often returning with more questions than answers.

The most documented and disturbing aspect of these expeditions is the phenomenon reported by multiple crews: their ships' lighting systems begin to pulse in synchronized patterns when approaching Solithar's orbit. Initially dismissed as equipment malfunction, the pattern has been observed across different vessels and technologies, suggesting an external influence.

These synchronized light patterns appear to correspond with the communication methods used by the Nhyrex Confluence, leading xenobiologists to theorize that the planet—or its inhabitants—may be attempting some form of long-distance contact. However, the intent behind these signals remains unclear: are they invitations, warnings, or something else entirely?

The few successful surface expeditions have reported strange phenomena: equipment powered by artificial light sources functioning far longer than expected, mysterious fluctuations in energy readings, and an overwhelming sense of being observed despite no visible presence. Some explorers have reported experiencing vivid dreams of walking through luminous underground cities, though these are typically attributed to the psychological stress of the mission.

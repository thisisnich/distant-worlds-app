## Description

Light as Currency is one of the most fascinating cultural innovations of the Nhyrex Confluence on Solithar. In their society, light transcends its physical properties to become both a biological necessity and the foundation of their entire economic and social system.

## Lore

For the Nhyrex, light is not merely illumination but life itself. Their bioengineered physiology directly harvests light as sustenance, making it a fundamental biological need. This necessity has transformed into a sophisticated currency system where different types and intensities of light hold varying values.

The quality and purity of light determine its worth: concentrated sunlight stored in crystalline matrices is highly valued, while ambient glow from brimshale formations serves as everyday currency. Rare or specialized light patterns—such as those encoded with historical information from The Great Archive—are considered priceless treasures.

The Nhyrex have developed complex financial instruments around light trading: light banks store and lend luminous energy, light merchants specialize in rare or exotic illumination, and light scholars assess the value of different photonic qualities. Their entire economic ecosystem revolves around the collection, storage, refinement, and exchange of various forms of luminous energy.

This system has created a society where hoarding light is not just greed but survival, and sharing light is the ultimate act of generosity. It reinforces their cultural emphasis on silence and reverence, as any disruption to light's natural flow is seen as economically and spiritually damaging.

# Storm Grid Memory

Storm Grid Memory refers to a unique meteorological phenomenon on Thalassos, where the planet's pervasive and powerful storms exhibit a tendency to follow the geometric patterns of ancient, failed terraforming grids. These invisible, ghost-like pathways dictate the movement and intensity of weather systems.

## Significance:

- **Persistent, Organized Storm Activity**: The planet's weather literally **"remembers" the artificial grid**, leading to persistent and highly organized storm activity. This predictability, paradoxically, allows for some degree of planning amidst the chaos, as communities can anticipate general storm paths.
- **Shapes Environment and Human Settlement**: This phenomenon profoundly **shapes both the natural environment and human settlement patterns** on Thalassos. Mobile outpost clusters navigate these predictable storm corridors, utilizing calm zones and avoiding areas prone to intense, grid-aligned tempests. The very architecture and lifestyle of Thalassos residents are a direct response to this inherent meteorological pattern.

## Overview

The Storm Grid Memory is a fascinating consequence of past attempts to engineer Thalassos. While the original terraforming infrastructure has long since crumbled and been reclaimed by the ocean, the energetic imprints left on the planet's atmospheric dynamics continue to influence its weather. Scientists speculate that residual energy fields or subtle alterations in the planet's electromagnetic properties created during the terraforming era are responsible for guiding the storm systems along these pre-defined lines. This phenomenon turns the planet into a living historical record, where every tempest is a reminder of human ambition. For the inhabitants, understanding and adapting to the Storm Grid Memory is not just a matter of meteorology, but a fundamental aspect of their survival, culture, and deep connection to their unique and unforgiving world.

name: Industrial Waste Recycling Economy
description: "An economic model where industrial byproducts—once discarded as waste—are transformed into essential resources, closing the loop between pollution and prosperity."
implications:
  - Enables sustainable industry on hostile worlds
  - Drives technological innovation in waste processing
  - Creates symbiotic trade relationships (e.g., with Ferraxis)
examples:
  - Ringsoil production from atmospheric particulates
  - Corrosive Industrial Gases refined from forge emissions

## Explanation
On KIII09-2-0909, what began as a simple extraction of valuable gases evolved into a planetary-scale recycling system. Sector 8's initiative to collect and process particulate residue from atmospheric farms turned a waste stream into a lucrative export—Ringsoil—fueling agriculture on Ferraxis and beyond. This closed-loop approach is now a model for sustainable industry on extreme worlds.

## Description

The Luminous Chasms are the defining geological feature of Solithar's surface, a vast network of deep, jagged ravines that crisscross the planet. These chasms are not merely geological formations but active components of Solithar's unique ecosystem, serving as both energy reservoirs and the primary habitat for the Nhyrex Confluence.

## Lore

Carved over millennia by a combination of extreme weather and geological processes, the chasms are composed primarily of brimshale, a unique sulfur-silica hybrid. During Solithar's scorching daylight hours, the brimshale actively absorbs and stores solar energy. As the planet rotates and the dense sulfuric clouds obscure the sun, the stored light is slowly released, causing the ravines to glow with a gentle, pulsating amber light.

This bioluminescent phenomenon is critical for the Nhyrex, providing the ambient illumination necessary for their subterranean cities and their light-harvesting physiologies. The deeper and more sheltered sections of the chasms are where the Nhyrex have established their vast, interconnected cities, drawing directly from the energy stored within the surrounding brimshale formations.

The Luminous Chasms are also key to Nhyrex culture and spirituality. They are seen as living veins of light, connecting the surface to the hidden depths where the Nhyrex thrive. Rituals of light-gathering and storytelling often take place within the chasms, reinforcing the intimate connection between the species and their luminous home.

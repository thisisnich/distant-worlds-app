## Description
From orbit, the Ring City is a seamless, metallic band shimmering above the volcanic planet, its surface alive with city lights and the glow of distant forges. Beneath, the world's darkness is broken by rivers of molten fire.

## Lore
The Ring City is the ultimate expression of adaptation and ambition—a city built not on land, but above a world too hostile for life. Each of its eight sectors is a city-state in its own right, with unique architecture, industries, and politics. The Pyrosil and humans live side by side, their cultures and skills intertwined by necessity and history.

The city's infrastructure is a marvel: rotating for gravity, stabilized by the planet's gravitational anomaly and powerful magnets, with emergency voidrum thrusters ready for atmospheric disruptions. Pillars, once the foundation of the first settlements, now serve as anchor points and transport hubs, connecting the ring to the surface far below.

The Ring City is a place of contrasts—wealth and poverty, danger and opportunity, tradition and innovation. Its markets trade in everything from plasma crystals to agricultural substrate, and its council chambers echo with the debates of sector leaders and Pyrosil advisors. For all its challenges, the Ring City is a beacon of survival and ingenuity in the galaxy's most unforgiving forge.

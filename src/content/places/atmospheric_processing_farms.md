## Description
Vast, multi-level facilities hang in the lower reaches of the ring, their intakes and collectors constantly drawing in the planet's thick, toxic atmosphere. Originally, these farms were designed solely to harvest corrosive industrial gases for export and advanced manufacturing. The particulate residue—dense mineral dust—was simply vented back into the atmosphere, pollution being of little concern with no surface population.

That changed when Sector 8, recognizing the potential value, began collecting and refining this discarded residue. Their innovation transformed waste into Ringsoil, a mineral-rich dirt now vital for Ferraxis's agriculture and the ring's own industrial cycles. Pyrosil workers, immune to atmospheric hazards, maintain the most dangerous systems, while human engineers oversee logistics and export.

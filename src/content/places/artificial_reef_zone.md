# Artificial Reef Zone

The Artificial Reef Zone on Thalassos consists of the sprawling underwater ruins of the planet's initial terraforming and aquaculture infrastructure. Over centuries, these remnants have been naturally repurposed and transformed into vibrant, thriving artificial reefs.

## Significance:

- **Ecosystem Anchors**: These reefs serve as crucial **ecosystem anchors**, providing extensive shelter, protection, and vital breeding grounds for the immense Thalassos-Adapted Terran Fish populations and other aquatic life. They are critical for the sustained health and productivity of the planet's unique marine biome.
- **Current Stabilization and Biodiversity Enhancement**: The physical structure of the reefs helps to **stabilize local currents**, reducing turbulence and creating more hospitable environments for marine organisms. This, in turn, significantly **enhances biodiversity** in what would otherwise be a vast, open ocean, fostering a complex and resilient aquatic food web.

## Overview

The Artificial Reef Zone is a poignant reminder of past human ambition on Thalassos and a testament to nature's capacity for reclamation. What were once sterile, utilitarian structures are now vibrant underwater cities, teeming with life. These reefs are not only ecological powerhouses but also hold cultural significance for the mobile outpost communities, often serving as traditional fishing grounds and points of reference within the seemingly boundless ocean. Their existence highlights the planet's unique blend of natural evolution and the lingering impacts of past technological endeavors, creating a truly distinctive environment for both its flora and fauna.

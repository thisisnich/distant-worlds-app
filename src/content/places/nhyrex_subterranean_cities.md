## Description

The Nhyrex Subterranean Cities are an intricate network of luminous settlements carved deep within Solithar's extensive ravine systems. These cities are marvels of adaptation and bioengineering, designed to thrive in the planet's extreme conditions where the surface is largely uninhabitable.

## Lore

Built from and integrated with crystalline spires, these cities are not just dwellings but living extensions of the Nhyrex themselves. The crystalline structures are engineered to capture and store solar energy during the brief, intense daylight hours, and then slowly release it as a gentle, ambient glow during the prolonged periods of darkness. This stored light is the lifeblood of the cities, powering their systems, illuminating their chambers, and sustaining the Nhyrex inhabitants.

The cities stretch for thousands of kilometers, interconnected by vast networks of crystalline conduits that facilitate the efficient distribution of light and information. Each city within the network is unique, reflecting the specialized functions and cultural nuances of its inhabitants, from research hubs dedicated to light-based science to vast communal living spaces.

Life in the subterranean cities is characterized by a profound reverence for light and silence. Communication primarily occurs through bioluminescent patterns, and the architecture itself is designed to harmonize with these light-based interactions, creating an immersive and visually rich environment. The cities are a testament to the Nhyrex's ability to transform a hostile environment into a sanctuary of sustained luminescence.

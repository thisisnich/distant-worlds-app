## Description (for reels & quick viewing)
A deep blue planet, veiled in storm-woven clouds, where the ocean remembers the scars of human ambition. Here, fish grow giant and flavorful, and the people—stocky, resilient, and fiercely independent—live in mobile outposts, braving the Pressure Pond's wrath for the galaxy's finest catch.

## Lore (for posts)
Thalassos is a world where the ocean is both home and adversary. The failed terraforming of past centuries left geometric scars in the planet's weather, with storms that trace invisible grid lines across the endless sea. The surface is a global saltwater ocean, saturated with unique minerals: thalassite, ferronitrate salts, and savorium trace elements. These dissolve into the water, feeding introduced Terran fish species that grow to prodigious size and develop a rich, meaty flavor prized across the galaxy.

Human settlements are sparse and fiercely independent, clustered in rare calm zones or roaming the ocean in mobile outposts—part fishing vessel, part storm shelter. The underwater ruins of the original grid infrastructure have become sprawling artificial reefs, anchoring the ecosystem and sheltering the fish. Life here is shaped by the relentless pressure: long-term residents become stocky and powerful, with dense bones and enhanced musculature, adapted for both underwater work and the rigors of the storm season.

Acclimatization is a rite of passage. Newcomers spend weeks in low-pressure chambers, slowly adjusting to the dense, mineral-laden air. Some never adapt and must leave; others emerge transformed, joining a culture that values strength, resilience, and cooperation. Disputes over fishing grounds are rare—there is ocean enough for all—but when they arise, they are settled through negotiation, sharing, or ritualized contests of skill and endurance.

The water extraction plants—heavily regulated and monitored—use multi-stage hyperfiltration and ion-exchange to produce ultra-pure water for export to KII09-2-0808 and Ferraxis, while preserving the delicate mineral balance that sustains the local ecosystem.

Thalassos is a world of abundance and adversity, where the ocean's bounty is matched only by its danger, and where those who stay long enough are changed—physically, culturally, and perhaps even spiritually—by the Pressure Pond's embrace.

## Extended Lore (worldbuilding & deeper reading)
The unique mineral composition of Thalassos's ocean is the legacy of ancient geological upheaval and centuries of human intervention. Thalassite, a magnesium-calcium silicate, accelerates muscle and bone growth in both fish and humans. Ferronitrate salts, rich in bioavailable iron, enhance oxygen transport and stamina. Savorium trace elements—potassium, zinc, selenium—contribute to the fish's robust health and savory flavor, while Pressure Pearl Crystals form within the largest fish, giving their flesh a unique texture and culinary value.

The artificial reefs—remnants of the failed terraforming grid—now anchor the ecosystem, providing shelter, breeding grounds, and stabilizing currents for the introduced Terran fish. With no native predators and abundant nutrients, these fish grow massive, their flesh dense and almost meaty, commanding premium prices throughout the sector.

Human society on Thalassos is shaped by the demands of survival. Outposts are mobile and self-sufficient, designed to anchor to underwater ridges during storms or outrun the worst tempests. Residents are stocky, physically formidable, and highly skilled in both fishing and storm survival. Their culture is egalitarian and cooperative, with disputes resolved through sharing or ritualized contests rather than violence.

Acclimatization is managed through low-pressure chambers in settlements, allowing new arrivals and tourists to adjust gradually. Some never fully adapt, but those who do find themselves changed—stronger, hardier, and uniquely suited to the planet's challenges.

Water extraction plants use advanced hyperfiltration and ion-exchange to separate minerals and purify water for export, especially to KII09-2-0808 and Ferraxis. These plants are strictly regulated to prevent ecological disruption and ensure the continued health of Thalassos's unique ecosystem.

Thalassos remains a world of paradox: a death trap and a goldmine, where the ocean's memory shapes both weather and society, and where every storm is a reminder of human ambition—and adaptation.

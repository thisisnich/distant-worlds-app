## Description (for reels & quick viewing)
Two glowing bands of cities wrap around a metallic world like wedding rings—one green with life, one red with industry—while magnetic carbon fuel burns, falls, and rises again in an eternal cycle that defies conventional physics.

## Lore (for posts)
On Ferraxis, the impossible happens daily. This metallic world spins beneath skies thick with magnetic carbon dust, its surface so conductive that temperatures swing from furnace-hot to absolute zero within kilometers. Only two narrow bands around the planet maintain stable climates—and it's here that civilization thrives in a dance of symbiosis.

The green band pulses with biological cities, their enclosed domes filtering oxygen and processing every molecule of precious imported water. Nothing is wasted here; the bio-engineers have perfected closed-loop systems where water cycles endlessly through treatment plants that gleam like jewels in the filtered light. These green metropolises don't just sustain life—they sustain industry.

The red band burns with the light of a thousand forges. Here, massive extractors pull Voidrium—the planet's signature purple ore—from the metallic crust, while polar Cryosteel is refined in facilities that never sleep. But the real miracle is the fuel: Magcarbon, a magnetic carbon compound that burns to power the forges, then settles as powder that naturally recharges its magnetic properties from the planet's field.

Between the bands, the surface is a wasteland of temperature extremes and magnetic storms. But in those two precious rings of civilization, Ferraxis has become the galaxy's premier industrial world—a place where even the fuel recycles itself, and water is worth more than the rarest metals they mine.

## Extended Lore (worldbuilding & deeper reading)
Magnetis shouldn't exist according to standard planetary physics, yet it has become one of the galaxy's most economically vital worlds. The planet's hyper-dense magnetic core generates a field so powerful that it affects everything from atmospheric composition to the fundamental chemistry of matter on its surface. This same field creates the extreme temperature bands that make most of the planet uninhabitable—except for two crucial zones where magnetic interference creates stable microclimates.

The discovery of Magcarbon changed everything. This unique magnetic carbon compound burns with incredible efficiency, powering the massive industrial operations that extract Voidrium from the planet's purple-rich equatorial regions and Cryosteel from the blue crystalline polar deposits. But Magcarbon's true miracle lies in its regenerative cycle: when burned, it releases energy and breaks down into a fine powder that slowly reabsorbs magnetic energy from the planet's field, eventually reconstituting into usable fuel. This closed-loop energy system makes Magnetis one of the few truly self-sustaining industrial worlds.

The two city bands represent humanity's most sophisticated example of industrial-biological symbiosis. The green band houses the planet's life support systems—vast atmospheric processors, water reclamation facilities, and the hydroponic farms that feed both bands. Every citizen here is part of an elaborate ecological machine, where human breath becomes filtered oxygen, waste becomes nutrients, and imported water from the nearby ocean world of Aquatica flows through treatment systems so efficient that the same molecules might circulate for decades.

The red band roars with industry twenty-six hours a day. Massive mining platforms drill deep into the metallic crust, extracting the Voidrium that powers faster-than-light drives across the galaxy. Foundries work the Cryosteel that becomes the hull plating for colony ships. And everywhere, the Magcarbon burns—in refineries, in transport systems, in the great atmospheric processors that keep the cities breathing clean air while storms of magnetic carbon dust rage outside.

The symbiosis goes deeper than mere cooperation. Waste heat from the industrial band helps power the biological processes of the green band. Organic compounds from the bio-cities become the catalysts that make Voidrium extraction possible. Water flows between both bands in a carefully managed cycle that ensures neither side ever runs dry. It's a planet-wide organism masquerading as a civilization.

The Magnetis Trade Guild controls the export of both Magcarbon and its synthetic derivatives to other worlds. When synthetic Magcarbon is burned elsewhere, its spent powder must be returned to Magnetis to recharge—creating a galactic economy centered on the planet's unique magnetic properties. Recent attempts to create artificial magnetic fields strong enough to recharge the powder have failed, making Magnetis irreplaceable in the galactic supply chain.

But beneath the industrial success lies a growing concern. The planet's magnetic field has been gradually intensifying over the past century, possibly due to the constant Magcarbon extraction affecting the core's stability. Some scientists fear that Magnetis might be building toward a magnetic reversal event that could sterilize the surface and disrupt the delicate balance that makes the city bands habitable. For now, the forges burn bright and the green cities flourish—but the question remains whether humanity's greatest industrial triumph might also be its most precarious achievement.

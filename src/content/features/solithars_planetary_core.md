## Description

Solithar's Planetary Core, though not directly accessible, is a fundamental component of the planet's unique characteristics. It is described as a standard planetary core but with an exceptionally high-density mineral composition, setting it apart from many other celestial bodies.

## Lore

The unusual density of Solithar's core is theorized to be a significant factor in the planet's intense gravitational pull and its distinctive geological activity. This density may contribute to the unique formation and properties of brimshale, the photoreactive mineral crucial to Solithar's ecosystem and the Nhyrex civilization.

Scientific models suggest that the core's composition and internal pressures play a role in the planet's internal heat generation, which in turn influences the geothermal activity responsible for shaping the vast ravine systems on the surface. While the Nhyrex Confluence thrives on solar energy, the planet's internal heat may have been a historical factor in the early evolution of life forms capable of surviving extreme conditions.

The core is also speculated to interact with Solithar's magnetic field in unusual ways due to its density, potentially influencing the planet's atmospheric patterns and the distribution of the sulfuric clouds. Understanding the exact composition and dynamics of Solithar's core remains a key area of interest for xeno-geologists studying the planet.

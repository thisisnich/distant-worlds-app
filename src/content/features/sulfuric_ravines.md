## Description

Solithar's Sulfuric Ravines are a defining geological characteristic of the planet, forming an extensive and complex network across its surface. These deep, winding chasms are not merely topographical features but are intrinsically linked to Solithar's unique atmosphere and the evolution of its indigenous life.

## Lore

The ravines are primarily composed of brimshale, a photoreactive sulfur-silica hybrid, which gives them their distinctive golden-amber hue. The dense, sulfuric atmosphere of Solithar often settles heavily within these ravines, creating an even more concentrated and corrosive environment compared to the open surface. This atmospheric density also contributes to the minimal solar penetration, making the ravines naturally darker and more sheltered.

Despite their hostile surface conditions, the Sulfuric Ravines are crucial for the Nhyrex Confluence. Their sheltered depths offer protection from the most extreme solar radiation and atmospheric corrosiveness, enabling the development of the Nhyrex subterranean cities. The brimshale within the ravines acts as a natural energy reservoir, absorbing solar light and slowly releasing it, providing a consistent source of illumination for the Nhyrex.

The geological processes that formed these ravines are believed to involve a combination of ancient volcanic activity, corrosive atmospheric erosion over millennia, and the unique properties of brimshale itself, which may expand and contract in response to light absorption. The constant interplay between the planet's internal heat, its sulfuric atmosphere, and the photoreactive minerals has sculpted a dynamic and otherworldly landscape.

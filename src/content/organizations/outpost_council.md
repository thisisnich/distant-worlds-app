# Outpost Council

The Outpost Council is a vital collective governance body on Thalassos, representing the interests and ensuring the cohesion of the planet's mobile outpost communities. It plays a central role in mediating disputes and coordinating resource management across the vast ocean.

## Role:

- **Collective Governance and Representation**: The Council serves as the primary **collective governance body** for the nomadic fishing communities, providing a unified voice for their diverse interests. It ensures that decisions are made with the consensus and benefit of all outposts.
- **Mediating Disputes**: A key function of the Council is **mediating disputes** that arise between individual outposts or within communities, often through established cultural practices like Ritual Claiming Fights. This maintains peace and cooperation, essential for survival in a challenging environment.
- **Coordinating Resource Management**: The Council is instrumental in **coordinating resource management**, particularly fishing rights and the movement of outposts to optimize catch while preserving the ecosystem. This ensures sustainable practices for the Thalassos-Adapted Terran Fish populations and other vital resources.

## Overview

The Outpost Council is a testament to the adaptable and cooperative nature of Thalassosian society. Composed of elected or chosen representatives from each mobile outpost, the Council typically convenes in neutral zones or through secure, long-range communications. Its decisions are guided by principles of shared prosperity, ecological stewardship, and the preservation of their unique nomadic lifestyle. The Council's effectiveness in navigating the challenges of Thalassos—from unpredictable storms to resource allocation—underscores the resilience and ingenuity of its people. It is the cornerstone of their self-governance, ensuring that the mobile outpost communities thrive as a collective, bound by common purpose and respect for their oceanic home.

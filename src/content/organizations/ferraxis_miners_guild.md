# Ferraxis Miners Guild

The Ferraxis Miners Guild stands as one of the most influential organizations in the outer rim territories, wielding considerable power over the mineral-rich world of Ferraxis. Established in the early days of the planet's colonization, the guild has evolved from a simple workers' collective into a sophisticated trade organization that effectively governs the planet's primary industry.

## History

The guild was founded when the first major mineral deposits were discovered beneath Ferraxis's crystalline surface. Initially formed as a protection association for miners facing dangerous working conditions, it gradually accumulated political and economic power as the planet's mineral wealth became apparent.

## Structure and Membership

The guild operates under a council system, with representatives elected from various mining sectors:
- **Deep Core Division**: Specialists in extracting rare minerals from the planet's dangerous core regions
- **Surface Operations**: Managing the more accessible but still valuable surface deposits
- **Equipment and Safety**: Responsible for maintaining the sophisticated machinery required for Ferraxis mining
- **Trade Relations**: Handling the complex negotiations for mineral exports to other worlds

## Influence and Operations

The guild's influence extends beyond simple mining operations. They:
- Set safety standards for all mining activities on Ferraxis
- Negotiate exclusive contracts with off-world buyers
- Maintain the planet's only spaceport dedicated to mineral transport
- Provide emergency services for mining accidents

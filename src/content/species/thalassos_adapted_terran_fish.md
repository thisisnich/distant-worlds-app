# Thalassos-Adapted Terran Fish

Earth-origin fish species introduced to Thalassos, selectively bred for survival in its high-pressure, mineral-rich ocean.

## Key Traits:

- **Exceptional size and muscle density** due to abundant thalassite and ferronitrate salts.
- **Dense, meaty flesh** with a unique savory flavor profile from savorium trace elements.
- **No native predators**, allowing for rapid growth and high population density.
- **Pressure Pearl Crystals** occasionally form in the largest individuals, prized in cuisine and medicine.

## Overview

The Thalassos-Adapted Terran Fish are a remarkable example of bio-engineering and environmental adaptation. Introduced from Earth, these fish have undergone generations of selective breeding to thrive in the unique, high-pressure, and mineral-rich oceanic environment of Thalassos. Their most striking characteristic is their immense size and the unusual density of their muscle tissue, a direct result of the abundant thalassite and ferronitrate salts dissolved in the planet's oceans. This mineral-rich diet also imbues their flesh with a distinctive, savory flavor, highly prized across the galaxy.

Lacking natural predators in the Thalassos ecosystem, these fish enjoy rapid growth rates and achieve high population densities, making them a cornerstone of the planet's economy. A unique byproduct of their environment and physiology is the formation of Pressure Pearl Crystals within the tissues of the largest individuals. These microcrystalline inclusions are not only sought after for their unique texture and culinary appeal but are also used in local medicine for their purported health benefits. The cultivation and harvesting of these fish are central to the culture and survival of the mobile outpost communities on Thalassos, underscoring the deep connection between the planet's unique environment and its inhabitants' way of life.

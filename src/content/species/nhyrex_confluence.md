# Nhyrex Confluence

**Type:** Bioengineered Light-Harvesting Species
**Associated Planet:** Solithar

## Description
The Nhyrex Confluence is a species that evolved beyond conventional biology, choosing adaptation over extinction on the desert world of Solithar. They bioengineered their physiology to harvest light directly through specialized skin cells, transforming from a carbon-based species into something entirely new.

## Biology & Adaptation
Their underground cities are built from crystalline spires that store solar energy, and their entire culture revolves around the sacred collection and sharing of illumination. They communicate through intricate bioluminescent patterns, believing sound disrupts light's natural flow.

## Culture & Interaction
Their greatest achievement is the Great Archive, a city-sized crystal formation that stores the collective memory of their species in pure light. Recent surveys suggest they may have made contact with other light-based civilizations across the galaxy, possibly serving as keepers of knowledge too vast for any single world to contain.

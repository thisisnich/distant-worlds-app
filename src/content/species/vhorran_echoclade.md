# Vhorran Echoclade

**Type:** Crystalline Sentient Species
**Associated Planet:** Calyx-Vehl

## Description
The Vhorran Echoclade are crystalline beings who have built a civilization from sound itself deep beneath Calyx-Vehl's surface. They don't speak, but rather resonate, with their cities being vast networks of polished resonance chambers where every vibration carries meaning, memory, and prophecy.

## Biology & Adaptation
They have evolved not just to survive their world's extremes, but to become an extension of the planet itself. Their crystalline biology indicates possible artificial enhancement, suggesting genetic modifications that allowed them to process vibrational data directly through their nervous systems. They harvest the planet's endless storms through massive stridulators, turning wind into power and chaos into communication.

## Culture & Interaction
To humans, Calyx-Vehl and the Vhorran are madness given form. The constant harmonic frequencies and their clicking language drive most visitors to psychological breakdown. The phenomenon known as "Glasshowl Syndrome" affects non-Vhorran visitors with persistent auditory hallucinations, some of which contain prophetic information.

## Description
The Vhorran Echoclade are crystalline beings who have built a civilization from sound itself deep beneath Calyx-Vehl's surface. They don't speak, but rather resonate, with their cities being vast networks of polished resonance chambers where every vibration carries meaning, memory, and prophecy.

## Biology & Adaptation
They have evolved not just to survive their world's extremes, but to become an extension of the planet itself. Their crystalline biology indicates possible artificial enhancement, suggesting genetic modifications that allowed them to process vibrational data directly through their nervous systems. They harvest the planet's endless storms through massive stridulators, turning wind into power and chaos into communication.

Their bodies are composed of living crystal matrices that can vibrate at precise frequencies, allowing them to communicate through complex harmonic patterns. These crystalline structures also serve as natural amplifiers and resonators, enabling them to detect and interpret vibrations from across vast distances within their planet's crust.

## Culture & Communication
The Vhorran society is built entirely around sound and vibration. Their cities are architectural marvels of acoustics, with every surface designed to amplify, redirect, or modify sound waves. They have developed a sophisticated harmonic language where meaning is conveyed not just through frequency but through complex combinations of pitch, rhythm, and resonance patterns.

Their culture views sound as the fundamental force of creation and communication. They believe that all matter vibrates at specific frequencies, and by understanding and manipulating these vibrations, they can influence the physical world around them.

## Interaction with Other Species
To humans, Calyx-Vehl and the Vhorran are madness given form. The constant harmonic frequencies and their clicking language drive most visitors to psychological breakdown. The phenomenon known as "Glasshowl Syndrome" affects non-Vhorran visitors with persistent auditory hallucinations, some of which contain prophetic information that has proven eerily accurate.

Despite this challenge, some xenobiologists theorize that the Vhorran's prophetic abilities may be the result of their capacity to detect and interpret vibrational patterns across vast scales of time and space, potentially giving them insight into future events through harmonic resonance.

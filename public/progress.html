        <li>Created `world_001_aetheris.md` inside `content` with provided data.</li>
        <li>Created `implementation.md` to explain the project structure.</li>
        <li>Created this `progress.html` file.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Implemented slug-based routing for planet pages.</li>
        <li>Renamed `src/pages/planets/[id].astro` to `src/pages/planets/[slug].astro`.</li>
        <li>Corrected `import.meta.glob` paths in `src/pages/index.astro` and `src/pages/planets/[slug].astro` to correctly locate markdown files after `content` moved to `src`.</li>
        <li>Updated styling in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` based on `index.html` inspiration.</li>
        <li>Refactored `src/pages/index.astro` to incorporate hero section, info cards, and footer for improved layout.</li>
        <li>Added a starry background to the index page.</li>
        <li>Refactored markdown files to use consistent markdown formatting.</li>
        <li>Implemented dynamic content loading for planet details.</li>
        <li>Created a wiki-like lore organization (2024-06-17, Version 1.1)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrated "Related Lore" section on planet detail pages (`src/pages/planets/[slug].astro`) to parse and display links from markdown files (already implemented).</li>
            <li>Created `src/pages/resources/[slug].astro` for resource redirection (2024-06-18, Version 1.2).</li>
            <li>Created `src/pages/relationships/[slug].astro` for relationships content display (2024-06-18, Version 1.3).</li>
            <li>Created `src/pages/lore-connections/[slug].astro` for lore connections content display (2024-06-18, Version 1.3).</li>
            <li>Created `src/content/resources/` directory and populated with individual markdown files for each resource (e.g., `graviton_core.md`, `magcarbon.md`).</li>
            <li>Created `src/content/species/` directory and populated with individual markdown files for each species (e.g., `vhorran_echoclade.md`, `nhyrex_confluence.md`).</li>
            <li>Created `src/content/relationships/` directory and populated with individual markdown files for each significant relationship or phenomenon (e.g., `ferraxis_industrial_biological_symbiosis.md`).</li>
            <li>Integrated links to these new wiki files into existing planet markdown files (`001_aetheris.md`, `004_ferraxis.md`, `003_calyx_vehl.md`, `002_solithar.md`) via a "Related Lore" section for easy navigation.</li>
            <li>Expanded "Related Lore" section with new categories (Places, Planetary Features, Technology, Concepts) and populated `002_solithar.md` accordingly (2024-07-29, Version 1.4).</li>
            <li>Created slug files for new lore categories: `src/pages/places/[slug].astro`, `src/pages/features/[slug].astro`, `src/pages/technology/[slug].astro`, and `src/pages/concepts/[slug].astro` to enable routing to the new markdown content (2024-07-29, Version 1.5).</li>
            <li>Created content collections configuration file `src/content/config.ts` to define all auto-generated collections: concepts, features, lore_connections, places, relationships, resources, species, technology, and planets with proper TypeScript schemas for type safety (2024-07-29, Version 1.6).</li>
            <li>Fixed resources page error by converting `src/pages/resources/[slug].astro` from redirect system to content display system, and created missing `src/pages/species/[slug].astro` to handle species content routing (2024-07-29, Version 1.7).</li>
            <li>Updated resource and species files with proper frontmatter structure and Related Lore sections containing correct planet links that redirect to planet pages using proper slug-based URLs (e.g., `/planets/solithar`, `/planets/calyx-vehl`) (2024-07-29, Version 1.8).</li>
            <li>Enhanced planet link styling across all lore page types (resources, species, places, features, technology, concepts, relationships) with distinctive orange styling and hover effects to make associated planet links more prominent and visually distinct in Related Lore sections (2024-07-29, Version 1.9).</li>
            <li>Added Related Lore sections to all relationship files and created new relationship file for Aetheris human research expeditions. Updated Ferraxis relationship file with comprehensive related lore links including planets, resources, places, and concepts. Created Human Research Expeditions relationship for Aetheris to document ongoing human coalition research efforts and updated Aetheris planet file to reference this relationship (2024-12-19, Version 2.0).</li>
            <li>Created comprehensive wiki navigation system with collection index pages and central wiki hub. Added index pages for all collections (resources, species, places, features, technology, concepts, lore-connections) to enable browsing of all content types. Created main wiki page (`/wiki`) that serves as a central navigation hub displaying all collections with counts and descriptions, providing users with easy access to explore the entire Distant Worlds universe content. Added Wiki link to main navigation navbar for easy access from any page (2024-12-21, Version 2.1).</li>

        <li>Ensure site responsiveness for various screen sizes.</li>
        <li>Create a more robust content management strategy for planet data.</li>
        <li>Add a "Buy" button to the planet pages.</li>
        <li>Add price tag to the planet pages.(depends on how many md files are claimed (md files tag "claimed" = true))</li>

        <li>Implemented dynamic content loading for planet details.</li>
        <li>Created a wiki-like lore organization (2024-06-17, Version 1.1)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrated "Related Lore" section on planet detail pages (`src/pages/planets/[slug].astro`) to parse and display links from markdown files (already implemented).</li>
            <li>Created `src/pages/resources/[slug].astro` for resource redirection (2024-06-18, Version 1.2).</li>

            <li>Created `src/content/species/` directory and populated with individual markdown files for each species (e.g., `vhorran_echoclade.md`, `nhyrex_confluence.md`).</li>
            <li>Created `src/content/relationships/` directory and populated with individual markdown files for each significant relationship or phenomenon (e.g., `ferraxis_industrial_biological_symbiosis.md`).</li>
            <li>Integrated links to these new wiki files into existing planet markdown files (`001_aetheris.md`, `004_ferraxis.md`, `003_calyx_vehl.md`, `002_solithar.md`) via a "Related Lore" section for easy navigation.</li>
            <li>Expanded "Related Lore" section with new categories (Places, Planetary Features, Technology, Concepts) and populated `002_solithar.md` accordingly (2024-07-29, Version 1.4).</li>
            <li>Created slug files for new lore categories: `src/pages/places/[slug].astro`, `src/pages/features/[slug].astro`, `src/pages/technology/[slug].astro`, and `src/pages/concepts/[slug].astro` to enable routing to the new markdown content (2024-07-29, Version 1.5).</li>
            <li>Created content collections configuration file `src/content/config.ts` to define all auto-generated collections: concepts, features, lore_connections, places, relationships, resources, species, technology, and planets with proper TypeScript schemas for type safety (2024-07-29, Version 1.6).</li>
            <li>Fixed resources page error by converting `src/pages/resources/[slug].astro` from redirect system to content display system, and created missing `src/pages/species/[slug].astro` to handle species content routing (2024-07-29, Version 1.7).</li>
            <li>Updated resource and species files with proper frontmatter structure and Related Lore sections containing correct planet links that redirect to planet pages using proper slug-based URLs (e.g., `/planets/solithar`, `/planets/calyx-vehl`) (2024-07-29, Version 1.8).</li>
            <li>Enhanced planet link styling across all lore page types (resources, species, places, features, technology, concepts, relationships) with distinctive orange styling and hover effects to make associated planet links more prominent and visually distinct in Related Lore sections (2024-07-29, Version 1.9).</li>
            <li>Added Related Lore sections to all relationship files and created new relationship file for Aetheris human research expeditions. Updated Ferraxis relationship file with comprehensive related lore links including planets, resources, places, and concepts. Created Human Research Expeditions relationship for Aetheris to document ongoing Vanguard Sciences Collective research efforts and updated Aetheris planet file to reference this relationship (2024-12-19, Version 2.0).</li>
            <li>Created comprehensive wiki navigation system with collection index pages and central wiki hub. Added index pages for all collections (planets, resources, species, places, features, technology, concepts, relationships, lore-connections) to enable browsing of all content types. Created main wiki page (`/wiki`) that serves as a central navigation hub displaying all collections with counts and descriptions. Added Wiki dropdown navigation menu to navbar with direct links to all collection index pages using intuitive emojis and smooth hover animations. Enhanced dropdown with click-to-toggle functionality that keeps the menu open when clicked, with automatic closing when clicking outside, providing users with persistent access to navigation options (2024-12-21, Version 2.1).</li>
            <li>Added Organizations collection system for guilds, associations, and organizations. Created complete organizations collection with TypeScript schema definition including organization_id, name, type, location, description, purpose, membership, and influence fields. Implemented organizations index page (`/organizations`) and dynamic slug routing (`/organizations/[slug].astro`) following established patterns. Added organizations section to main wiki page with proper collection count display and descriptive text. Updated navigation dropdown menu to include organizations link with appropriate emoji. Created example organization content (Ferraxis Miners Guild) demonstrating the content structure and Related Lore linking system. This addition provides a framework for documenting the social and political landscape of the Distant Worlds universe (2024-12-22, Version 2.2).</li>
            <li>Expanded Organizations collection with key galactic powers and research institutions. Created comprehensive organization files for the Æclim Institute (rogue research group investigating Fermi Points and spatial anomalies), The Vanguard Sciences Collective (multinational organization sending expeditions to Aetheris), and Galactic Survey Consortium (AI-driven coalition that classifies galactic phenomena). These organizations form the core political and scientific framework around Aetheris research, establishing the tension between human persistence and rational AI-driven exploration policies. Each organization includes detailed history, structure, relationships, and extensive Related Lore linking to planets, resources, concepts, and relationships already established in the universe (2024-12-22, Version 2.3).</li>
            <li>Refactored Human Coalition to The Vanguard Sciences Collective across all content. Renamed organization file from `human_coalition.md` to `vanguard_sciences_collective.md` and updated all references throughout the codebase including Æclim Institute, Galactic Survey Consortium, and Aetheris human research expedition relationship files. Updated progress documentation to reflect the new naming. The name "Vanguard Sciences Collective" better captures their role as humanity's cutting-edge scientific exploration organization while maintaining the sense of multinational cooperation and advanced research capabilities (2024-12-22, Version 2.4).</li>
            <li>Created Galactic Industrial Optimization Network (GION) as a new AI-driven industrial coalition. This organization represents the galaxy's approach to large-scale industrialization and resource extraction, prioritizing stable, profitable operations over high-risk anomalous locations. Despite Aetheris containing valuable resources like graviton cores and crystalline silicates, GION classifies it as a "Category 5 Industrial Hazard" due to gravitational instability and infrastructure impossibility. The organization provides a contrast to research-focused groups, emphasizing economic efficiency and sustainable extraction. Added cross-references to all existing organization files to establish relationships within the galactic political landscape (2024-12-22, Version 2.5).</li>
            <li>Expanded GION lore to include its calculated aversion to Calyx-Vehl and Solithar due to political and integration complexities, and detailed the challenges with human strongholds like Ferraxis, where The Vanguard Sciences Collective supports human defenses. This lore highlights GION's strict adherence to efficiency and its perception of organic irrationality in complex planetary engagements (2024-12-22, Version 2.6).</li>
            <li>Fixed planets not displaying on the wiki by moving planet markdown files from `src/content/` to `src/content/planets/`. This aligns the content files with the `astro:content` collection configuration, allowing the planets index page (`src/pages/planets/index.astro`) to correctly fetch and display the planet data (2024-12-22, Version 2.7).</li>
            <li>Updated planet links on the main planets page (`src/pages/planets/index.astro`) to use the planet's name (slugified) in the URL instead of the numerical ID from the filename (2024-07-29, Version 2.8).</li>
            <li>Added organization links to relevant planet lore, linking to Æclim Institute, Galactic Industrial Optimization Network, The Vanguard Sciences Collective, and Ferraxis Miners Guild from their respective planet pages (2024-07-29, Version 2.9).</li>
            <li>Fixed `astro:content` module not found error by removing conflicting `defineCollection` and `collections` object from `astro.config.mjs`, allowing Astro to correctly process content types from `src/content/config.ts` (2024-12-22, Version 2.10).</li>
            <li>Ensured full visibility of 'Related Lore' descriptions by adjusting parsing and rendering logic in `src/pages/planets/[slug].astro` to correctly capture and display all descriptive text associated with related items (2024-12-22, Version 2.11).</li>
            <li>Significantly expanded Cryosteel resource content with detailed properties, refinement process, galactic significance, industrial ecosystem integration, and strategic implications. Added comprehensive sections covering thermal regulation, magnetic resonance shielding, structural integrity, and self-repair properties. Detailed the polar refinement process and grading system, established galactic trade importance and strategic tensions between major organizations. Enhanced Related Lore section with links to organizations and concepts (2024-12-22, Version 2.12).</li>
            <li>Enhanced Wiki Dropdown Navigation: Implemented improved functionality for the Wiki dropdown menu in the navbar (`src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`), ensuring that clicking the "Wiki ▼" button now correctly closes the menu if it is already open, providing a more intuitive user experience (2024-07-30, Version 2.13).</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
